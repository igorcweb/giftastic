### Giphy API Search App

This app allows users to search for up to ten gifs relating to a topic of their choosing. The user is given 9 default topics with the option to add new topics or remove all topics and start from scratch. A new button is created every time a new topic is added. When a button is pushed 10 gifs are displayed.

The user has the option to remove specific gifs from the view, clear all gifs, or add specific gifs to favorites. When gifs are added to favorites a new `favorites` button is created. If all favorites are removed, the `favorites` button disappears from the view.

The added buttons as well as list of favorites persist in local storage. If the `reset` button is pressed the added buttons disappear, and everything is removed from the local storage.

The app is hosted at https://igorcweb.github.io/giftastic.
